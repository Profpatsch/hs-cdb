hs-cdb is a library to read (and maybe one day write) CDB files.

For more information on the CDB file format, please consult:
http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html

cdbInit :: FilePath -> IO CDB

cdbGet :: (Packable k, Unpackable v) => CDB -> k -> Maybe v
cdbGetAll :: (Packable k, Unpackable v) => CDB -> k -> [v]
cdbHasKey :: (Packable k) => CDB -> k -> Bool
cdbCount :: (Packable k) => CDB -> k -> Int

What these do should be fairly straightforward. ByteString, [Word8], and
String are all instances of Packable and Unpackable, so you can lookup
by any of these and the appropriate type will be returned. hs-cdb uses
ByteStrings internally, so use these for optimum performance.

TODO:
- writing
- a nicer way to pull words out of the bytestring would be cool
