hs-cdb is a library to read (and maybe one day write) CDB files.

For more information on the CDB file format, please consult:
http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html

the important functions to know are

cdbInit :: FilePath -> IO CDB

cdbGet :: CDB -> ByteString -> Maybe ByteString
cdbGetAll :: CDB -> ByteString -> [ByteString]

you can probably guess how these work.

You can turn a String into a ByteString with
Data.ByteString.Char8.pack

TODO:
- writing
- a nicer interface for the common case of using strings as keys/values
- a nicer way to pull words out of the bytestring would be cool
- better documentation
